  "Judgement": "\n<h2>Judgement</h2>\n\n<h3>Internal Block</h3>\n<p>You\u2019re stuck because you\u2019re afraid to answer the call. Or you're buried in past regrets and self-judgment, unable to rise into your next chapter. You may be holding on to a version of yourself that no longer serves who you're becoming, or resisting the vulnerability that comes with starting anew.</p>\n\n<h3>Jungian Archetype: The Awakening / The Inner Calling</h3>\n<p>Judgement represents the call of the Self rising from the unconscious \u2014 an invitation to step into greater authenticity. In Jungian psychology, this card reflects the moment when we are asked to integrate the past and release outdated versions of ourselves. It is the reanimation of the soul through accountability, forgiveness, and courage. This archetype signals a spiritual rebirth \u2014 a time to acknowledge all that you\u2019ve been, make peace with it, and become more fully who you are. The trumpet sounds not to judge you, but to awaken you.</p>\n\n<h3>Shadow Work Prompt</h3>\n<p><em>\u201cWhat calling have I been denying \u2014 and what old story must I forgive to move forward?\u201d</em></p>\n\n<h3>Integration Practice</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Reflect on one time you knew what to do \u2014 but ignored it.</li>\n  <li>Forgive yourself for missing a step; it was part of the path.</li>\n  <li>Write your own redemption story, starting today.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Final Reflection</h3>\n<p>Judgement says: \u201cYou\u2019re not stuck \u2014 you\u2019re awakening. Your true life is calling.\u201d</p>\n",
  "World": "\n<h2>The World</h2>\n<h3>Internal Block</h3>\n<p>You\u2019re stuck on the threshold of completion. Maybe you don\u2019t believe it\u2019s safe to be whole. Or you\u2019re afraid of starting the next cycle \u2014 so you hover at the end of this one.</p>\n\n<h3>Jungian Archetype: Wholeness / Completion of the Journey</h3>\n<p>The World is the archetype of integration and self-realization. In Jungian psychology, it symbolizes the final stage of individuation \u2014 the process through which the personality becomes whole by embracing all aspects of the self, both conscious and unconscious. This card suggests the harmonious union of opposites, inner and outer, masculine and feminine, personal and collective. It represents a deep psychological synthesis where the Self is not only discovered but fully embodied.</p>\n\n<h3>Shadow Work Prompt</h3>\n<p><em>\u201cWhat would change if I allowed myself to feel complete, worthy, and whole \u2014 right now?\u201d</em></p>\n\n<h3>Integration Practice</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Celebrate something you\u2019ve already completed \u2014 without minimizing it.</li>\n  <li>Write a ritual of closure for one chapter of your life.</li>\n  <li>Reflect: \u201cWhat do I now carry into the next adventure?\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Final Reflection</h3>\n<p>The World reminds you: \u201cYou\u2019re not stuck \u2014 you\u2019re rebirthing. Completion is the portal to your next dance.\u201d</p>\n"
